Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
Was out of town and unable to meet with classmates, I did get the chance to talk to some friends from home about my assignmnet and was able to graph out visually what I wanted to do by explaning it.
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
N/A
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I am starting to recognize some of the elements in java that I had learned in highschool but forgot about. If I am being honest, I prefer python as it is a lot more straightfoward of a program, but I can appricirate the different things Java has to offer.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
There are a lot of syntax differences which was the cause of most of my bugs. I feel like some of the methods in Java tend to be less clean or longer than python methods. This could just be because there are simpler methods I didnt know about, but when comparing the approaches I used to how I would have written them in Python, the Java versions were generally longer.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I struggled the most with changing the user input into mirrored responses. It took me awhile to figure out how splitting the strings and then replacing the mirror words with new ones worked. I was not able to figure out how to make the first letter of the chatbot's response uppercase even when the user's was not. I assumed I would need to use the toUpperCase() method, but I wasnt sure how to have the method only focus on the first character. I also was not able to figure out the me/I dilemma. I think I needed to do something with if statements to replace certain words IF the parameters were met. My advice would be to start the assignment as early as possible. I believe that if I had given myself more time, I might have been able to figure out the things I struggled with.
